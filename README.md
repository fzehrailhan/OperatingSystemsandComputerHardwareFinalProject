## Question 2 – Disk Allocation

Implemented algorithms:  
- Bitmap Allocation  
- Linked-List Allocation  

Run my versions to see allocation experiments and outputs.

---

## Question 3 – Memory Allocation

Implemented algorithms:  
- Best Fit  
- Worst Fit  
- Next Fit  

Memory is simulated using a linked list of free segments.

## ▶ How to Run the Code

### Question 2 (Disk Allocation)

```bash
python "Question2/My_Codes/bitmap.py"
python "Question2/My_Codes/linkedlist.py"
```

### Question 3 (Memory Allocation)

```bash
python "Question3/freelistandfits.py"
```
